Matlab files for cheap quadrature over spline curvilinear polygons and 3D domains (w.r.t. QMC based measures).

The .zip files contain two folder with demos that perform experiments respectively over spline curvilinear polygons and 3D complex domains.

Each folder contains in particular
demo_ADE: quadrature of polynomial integrands (to establish numerically the properties regarding the degree of exactness), 
demo_CUB: quadrature of polynomial integrands,
demo_CPU: average cputimes of the rules,
demo_WEIGHTS: distribution of the weights,
demo_SUMWEIGHTS: stability of the rules.
Furthermore, a routine shows the geometry of the domain and the distribution of the nodes in a parallelepiped containing the integration domain.
